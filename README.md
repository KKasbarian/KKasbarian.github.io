1.4v: Fourth update to the site, added intro loader animation while the page loads and animated some elements on scroll.

1.5v: Fifth update to the site, A huge update, where I changed the form submission request from Formspree to a better and convenient option which doesn't even need a server or backend to be used. There is also an AJAX response when a form is submitted (So no redirects, but wait till the message shows, it could take time, so don't send a form twice) and spam prevention is (hopefully) there too. Finally, I deleted the local Saved Font Awesome folder and instead added an External Link in my HTML.

1.6v: Sixth update to the site, I changed the layout of the 'Some Skills' section from stacking horizontally to stacking vertically of the icons. Changed the text of the 'About' section and made it more professional. Finally, I added few more social links on the footer.

1.7: Seventh and a small update, I added a "Last Updated" section at the bottom of the page.

1.8: Eigth and a critical update, I fixed the navigational buttons not-working at-all issue.
